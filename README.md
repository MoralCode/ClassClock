# ClassClock


## What is ClassClock?
ClassClock is a web app to give students and teachers easy access to:
- current date and time
- daily schedules (You are on the Mon/Tues Schedule)
- the class period you are currently in (i.e. 2nd Period)
- a countdown until class is over
- the generic name of your next class (i.e. 3rd Period)

ClassClock is useful for:
- **Teachers** - to check how much teaching time is left in class
- **Students** - to remind themselves of  where they need to be and when
- **Parents** - to see the optimal time to contact their student without interfering with instruction time
- **Everyone** - to have quick and easy access to varied schedules that may otherwise be complicated, confusing or hard to remember


### Upcoming Features
Here are some features to look forward to in a future version:
 
 - [ ] Support for multiple schools (currently only supports one)
 - [ ] Detection of block (A/B) schedules
 - [ ] Countdown to school breaks (winter break, spriing break, summer .etc)
 - [ ] Support for custom schedules (assemblies, parades, combined schedules etc.)
 - [ ] The ability to change what is displayed
 - [ ] The ability for students to upload their schedules to get more detailed information such as teacher name and room number
